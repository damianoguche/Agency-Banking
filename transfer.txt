Banking Transaction Failure Scenario.
--------------------------------------
1. Understanding What Happened (the symptom)

Symptom:
The debit leg (sender’s account) succeeded.
The credit leg (receiver’s account) failed.
The reversal (rollback or compensation) did not happen.
The system ends up inconsistent — money appears “missing”.

2. Root Causes — Technical Scenarios
Let’s look at what could have gone wrong technically.

a. Partial Transaction Commit (Missing Atomicity)
If the debit and credit are not done atomically — e.g., separate 
database calls or service calls — one can succeed while the other 
fails.

b. Network / Middleware Failure
Even when both debit and credit succeed internally, the network may 
fail to return a success response, so the mobile app (or middleware) 
thinks something failed and doesn’t retry or confirm.

Example:
Debit succeeds on the core banking system.
The response times out.
The credit step never executes due to timeout.
Root cause: Communication failure between channels 
(mobile app ↔ middleware ↔ core banking).

c. Downstream System Failure

If the receiving system (e.g., destination bank, wallet, or payment 
switch) is unavailable, the sender’s debit might still post before the 
credit is confirmed.

Root cause: Lack of two-phase commit or guaranteed message delivery.

d. Application Crash or Process Interruption
If the application crashes or restarts after debit but before credit, 
the transaction state is lost. Rollback failure.

Root cause: No persistent transaction log or recovery mechanism.

e. Asynchronous Queue Failures
If the credit instruction is queued (for example, using Kafka or 
RabbitMQ) and the message is lost or not processed, the debit stays without a matching credit.

Root cause: Poor queue durability or retry configuration.

How It Should Work (The Ideal)
A fund transfer should be atomic — both debit and credit happen 
together or not at all.

In database terms:
const t = await sequelize.transaction();

try {
  await debit(sender, amount, { transaction: t });
  await credit(receiver, amount, { transaction: t });
  await t.commit();
} catch (err) {
  await t.rollback();
}


If either debit or credit fails, the entire transaction rolls back — 
so no partial posting.

In distributed systems, where sender and receiver are on different 
services or databases, use:
 - Two-Phase Commit (2PC), or
 - Outbox Pattern + SAGA pattern for compensating transactions.


 How It Can Be Resolved (Operationally)
------------------------------------------
If such an issue already occurred in production:

a. Transaction Reconciliation
- Compare debit logs vs credit logs:
- Find transactions where debit = success but credit = missing.
- Check transaction reference IDs and timestamps.

b. Investigate Middleware Logs
- Trace the API call chain (mobile app → middleware → core banking).
- Find where the process broke.

c. Retry or Manual Reversal
If credit failed:
- Reprocess the credit to the receiver, or
- Reverse the debit back to sender.

Typically handled by:
- Reconciliation scripts/jobs, or
- Operations/Settlement team (via dispute resolution queue).

d. Root Cause Fix
- Implement atomic transaction control (DB transaction or distributed 
lock).
- Add message retry and delivery confirmation.
- Use transaction state tracking table to ensure "no lost leg"
- Build automated reconciliation jobs that flag incomplete 
transactions for review.

Long-term / Preventive Resolution

| Fix                                          | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use atomic database transactions         | Wrap debit and credit in a single transaction so both succeed or both fail.         |
| Implement retry & idempotency*           | If a network fails, the system can retry without double posting.                    |
| Use message queues with durable delivery | Ensures no leg of a transaction is lost.                                            |
| Add reconciliation & recovery jobs       | Detect and automatically resolve incomplete transactions.                           |
| Implement the Outbox or SAGA pattern     | In microservices, these guarantee eventual consistency and compensation on failure. |
| Improve monitoring & alerting            | Early detection of “debit-only” anomalies.                                          |


| Problem                          | Prevention                                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Debit succeeds, credit fails     | Both wrapped in one transaction           |
| Race condition (double spending) | Row-level locking with `FOR UPDATE`       |
| Inconsistent balances            | Transaction rollback guarantees integrity |
| Concurrent transfers             | Isolation level prevents dirty reads      |


Optional Enhancements
- Implement retry logic for transient errors.
- Make the operation idempotent — same transaction reference won’t post 
twice.
- Add reconciliation scripts to verify posted transactions daily.
- Automated reconciliation job comparing wallet balances vs. 
transaction sum
- Webhook or message queue for notifying mobile app users
- Audit log triggers at the DB level for non-repudiation

a. Audit Log
An audit log (or audit trail) is a record of all activities or changes 
that occur in a system — especially those that affect sensitive data 
or transactions.

It answers questions like:
- Who did what?
- When did they do it?
- What data was changed?
- From where (IP, device, etc.)?

b. Triggers at the DB Level
A trigger is a special procedure in the database that automatically 
executes ('fires') when a specific event happens — like an 
INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

When we say "audit log triggers at the DB level" it means the database 
has built-in automatic mechanisms that:
- Detect changes to important tables (like Customers, Transactions, 
Wallets, etc.),
- Automatically write details of the change into an audit table,
- Without relying on the application layer.

The audit log + trigger mechanism supports non-repudiation by:
- Automatically recording every database change,
- Storing who made the change and when,
- Protecting the audit data from modification or deletion (e.g.,
using append-only tables or write-once storage).

EXAMPLE:

CREATE TRIGGER log_wallet_changes
AFTER UPDATE ON wallets
FOR EACH ROW
INSERT INTO wallet_audit_log (
    wallet_id,
    old_balance,
    new_balance,
    updated_by,
    updated_at
)
VALUES (
    OLD.id,
    OLD.balance,
    NEW.balance,
    CURRENT_USER,
    NOW()
);
