a Forensic Integrity Verification Job (a reconciliation script).
It will:

Compute and verify hash integrity of every audit record.
Detect tampering, deletions, or sequence gaps.
Store immutable results (signed or hashed).

Automatically alert Security & Audit teams if issues are found.

1. Core Principle: Hash-Chain for Non-Repudiation
We’ll extend each AuditLog record with:
previousHash → the hash of the previous audit record
recordHash → the hash of the current record’s content

That creates a blockchain-like chain, so if any record is deleted or 
altered, the chain breaks.
